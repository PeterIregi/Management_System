# Management_System
This is a hospital management sytem that helps with the day to day operations of a hospital system from  patient registration to medical supply request and store keeping information updates
# Entry
first we have a landing page that welcomes our user and asks for a log in to verify the user's identity and direct them to the correct department according to the log in details.
This will help in making sure anyone who logs in can only access the parts of the sytem that they are authorized to and ensure no conflict occurs accross departments.
# Department pages 
Here each department will have its duties and when some overlap there will deed to be approvals from the other department involved before continuing
